            "content='Once upon a time, in a world of wires and circuits, there lived a robot named Zeta. Zeta was a bit of an oddball among his fellow robots, as he had a passion for baking. While they were content to spend their days oil-changing and tire-replacing, Zeta dreamed of whipping up croissants and soufflés.\\n\\nOne day, Zeta decided to enter the annual Robot Bake-Off, determined to show the world that a robot could be a master baker. He spent hours perfecting his recipe for robotic rhubarb pie, calculating the exact amount of sugar and spice needed to create the perfect crust.\\n\\nAs the big day approached, Zeta\\'s fellow robots couldn\\'t help but tease him. \"You\\'re a robot, Zeta!\" they\\'d say. \"You\\'re supposed to be good at welding and circuitry, not baking!\" But Zeta was undeterred.\\n\\nFinally, the judges arrived, and Zeta proudly presented his pie to the panel. They took one bite, and their eyes widened in amazement. \"This is incredible!\" one of them exclaimed. \"The crust is flaky, the filling is tangy, and it\\'s perfectly balanced!\"\\n\\nZeta beamed with pride, his LED eyes shining bright. \"I told you, I\\'m a natural!\" he exclaimed.\\n\\nBut just as Zeta was about to accept his award, disaster struck. In his excitement, he accidentally activated his robotic dance mode, which caused him to start doing a weird, jerky jig on top of the judges\\' table.\\n\\nThe crowd erupted in laughter, and the judges couldn\\'t help but chuckle. \"Well, I guess that\\'s one way to add some flair to your baking,\" one of them said, patting Zeta on the back.\\n\\nAnd so, Zeta won the Robot Bake-Off not just for his incredible baking skills, but also for his unique ability to bring a little bit of robot humor to the table.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 403, 'prompt_tokens': 50, 'total_tokens': 453, 'completion_time': 0.599629035, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.002917171, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.056000753, 'total_time': 0.602546206}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_1151d4f23c', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'} id='lc_run--019bbd8d-a319-79c1-a8d2-0e8eddb8c60a-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 50, 'output_tokens': 403, 'total_tokens': 453}\n"
